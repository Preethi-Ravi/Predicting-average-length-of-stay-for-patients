# Predicting-average-length-of-stay-for-patients
Predicting the ideal length of stay for liver patients who got readmitted within first 30 days of their index admission

Calculating cost saved per visitlink

Findings
Average increase in LOS for index VisitLinks   = 2.95 ~ 3 days
Average Cost Saved per VisitLink  = $56,523.94

By increasing average LOS by 2.95 or 3 days in first index visit $56,523.94 costs will be saved on an average per VisitLink.
By staying 3 more days on the index visit, 3 extra days or 6 days in total of stay during readmission can be eliminated on an average
High correlations are found between ADC (Average daily Census), ADMTOT (Total Facility Admissions), BDTOT (Total Beds Staffed)
